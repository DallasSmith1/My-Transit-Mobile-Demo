<h1>My Transit Mobile</h1>

<p>I developed My Transit, a mobile application for GO Transit, using flutter. The app utilizes the GO Transit API to obtain comprehensive transit data, providing users with easy navigation and displaying valuable information that is not readily accessible.</p>
<p>The app provides has live tracking for trains and buses:</p>

<p>The app provides live alert feeds across the entire service including facilities and/or lines being out of service, future events, and scheduled construction. All alerts are easily accessable on the Alerts tab in the app:</p>

<p>The main feature in the app is the live tracking. The app can track a bus or train and provide live GPS pings to display to users. The tracking board also displays other information such as</p>
<ul>
  <li>Platform Number (up to 1 hour sooner than screens at stations)</li>
  <li>Scheduled Departure Time</li>
  <li>Computed Departure Time</li>
  <li>Any alerts that affect the current trip being tracked</li>
</ul>

<p>I created this desktop application solely for personal use and sharing with friends and family, with no intention of publishing it. The project served as a learning opportunity to master Tauri, explore new desktop application development methods, satisfy my curiosity, and broaden my expertise.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>You will need to have Tauri installed to be able to run this application in visual studio code and play around with it. </p>
<p>There is also an installer (exe) file for this application as well for anyone to use, if you are interested in installing this application and playing around with it, contact me (dallasagsmith@gmail.com) and I will give you access to the installer file.</p>
