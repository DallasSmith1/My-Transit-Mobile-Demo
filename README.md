<h1>My Transit Mobile</h1>

<p>I developed My Transit, a mobile application for GO Transit, using flutter. The app utilizes the GO Transit API to obtain comprehensive transit data, providing users with easy navigation and displaying valuable information that is not readily accessible.</p>
<p>The app provides live GPS tracking, departure times, and platform numbers for trains and buses:</p>

<p>The app allows you to save trips for easy access and seamlessly swap between them. When tracking a saved trip, the app will display:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Platform Number (up to 1 hour sooner than screens at stations)</li>
  <li>Scheduled Departure Time</li>
  <li>Computed Departure Time</li>
  <li>Quick ticket purchase buttons to be redirected to purchase the corresponding E-Ticket</li>
  <li>Any alerts that affect the current trip being tracked</li>
</ul>

<p>Easily find your selected trip whether it's a train or a bus and lays out the trip on the map giving stop details, and a better understanding of the trip:</p>
