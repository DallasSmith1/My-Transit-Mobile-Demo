<h1>My Transit Mobile</h1>

<p>I developed My Transit, a mobile application for GO Transit, using flutter. The app utilizes the GO Transit API to obtain comprehensive transit data, providing users with easy navigation and displaying valuable information that is not readily accessible.</p>
<p>The app provides live GPS tracking, departure times, and platform numbers for trains and buses:</p>

<p>The app allows you to save trips for easy access and seamlessly swap between them. When tracking a saved trip, the app will display:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Platform Number (up to 1 hour sooner than screens at stations)</li>
  <li>Scheduled Departure Time</li>
  <li>Computed Departure Time</li>
  <li>Quick ticket purchase buttons to be redirected to purchase the corresponding E-Ticket</li>
  <li>Any alerts that affect the current trip being tracked</li>
</ul>

<p>The app provides live alert feeds across the entire service including facilities and/or lines being out of service, future events, and scheduled construction. All alerts are easily accessible on the Alerts tab in the app:</p>

<p>I created this desktop application solely for personal use and sharing with friends and family, with no intention of publishing it. The project served as a learning opportunity to master Tauri, explore new desktop application development methods, satisfy my curiosity, and broaden my expertise.</p>

<p>You will need to have Tauri installed to be able to run this application in visual studio code and play around with it. </p>
<p>There is also an installer (exe) file for this application as well for anyone to use, if you are interested in installing this application and playing around with it, contact me (dallasagsmith@gmail.com) and I will give you access to the installer file.</p>
